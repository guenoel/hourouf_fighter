## About

This is a Portfolio Project for end of first year at [Holberton School](https://www.holbertonschool.fr/) by Guénoël Andrieux.

This game is inspired by "feed the monster" mobile app, the conference of Idriss Abderkane "Game of logos": *Game is the natural best way to learn* and by my children who love to play games to much on mobile phone.
